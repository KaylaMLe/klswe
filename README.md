## About this repository
The front end of my personal website is crafted to deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface that brings my portfolio to life through interactive elements and intuitive navigation. It ensures a seamless experience across devices, making it easy for users to explore and engage with my content.

## Getting started
This section provides an overview of the process to run the project, including installation steps and running/testing instructions.

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) (version 16 or above recommended)
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/KaylaMLe/klswe.git
cd klswe
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

### Running the project
To run the application locally:
```
npm run dev
```
This command will start Vite and make the site available at `http://localhost:5173`.

To build the application for production:
```
npm run build
```
This command will create an optimized production build of the project in the `klswe/dist` folder, ready for deployment.

To preview the production build locally:
```
npm run preview
```
This command serves the production build on a local server, allowing you to test the optimized version.

### Testing
To run all tests in the project:
```
npm run test
```

To run tests with a coverage report:
```
npm run test-coverage
```

To run a specific test file, include the `-- path/to/testfile.test.tsx` flag after either of the previous commands. The path can either be absolute or relative to the root folder, `klswe`.

## Project design

### Architecture
This frontend application communicates with a backend API to handle user-driven requests, sending inputs to the backend and receiving processed data in response. Individual components make API calls directly as needed, allowing the backend to manage complex data processing while the frontend focuses on displaying and interacting with the results.

### Component design
This project is structured with a modular component design, ensuring reusability and responsiveness across different pages. Key components are built to handle specific tasks, such as responsive layout adjustments, page metadata, and navigation, while smaller, focused components manage interactive elements like buttons and animations.

#### Contexts
Custom hooks and context providers manage shared state and encapsulate complex logic, enabling a consistent and responsive experience across components. Contexts are named following the `<Purpose/Content>Context` convention. Corresponding hooks are named `use<Purpose/Content>`, and providers are named `<Purpose/Content>Provider`.
- `CsrfCookieContext`: Manages the CSRF token for requests to the backend API. The `CsrfCookieProvider` checks for an existing CSRF token in cookies or local storage; if none is found, it fetches a new token from the backend and updates the context.
- `PageNumberContext`: Tracks the current page number, making it easy for components to identify and update the active page. The `CurrentPageProvider` exposes `currentPage` and `setCurrentPage` to child components, enabling them to highlight active pages and apply page-specific styles.
- `ViewPortContext`: Manages a boolean `isMobile` state, which adjusts based on the viewport width ("mobile" defined as <= 600px). The `IsMobileProvider` listens for window resizing events and updates `isMobile` accordingly, allowing components to conditionally render or style content based on the device type.

#### Higher-order components
Higher-order components are designed to wrap other components to add functionality or conditional styling. These components provide a foundation for responsive design and state-based style changes, making it easy to adapt UI elements to window and interaction states.
- `Responsive`: A versatile wrapper component used to apply conditional styling based on screen size, enabling seamless transitions between mobile and desktop layouts.
- `Toggle`: This component is designed to conditionally style elements. Toggle accepts a Component prop (allowing any component to be wrapped) and applies a default style by default, switching to an alternate style when the condition passed in is true. CSS transitions are used to create a smooth effect when the style changes. If the condition is false, the component applies the alternate style on hover and focus for added interactivity.

#### Layout components
Layout components establish the core structure of each page and serve as containers for page content, handling key tasks such as navigation, page metadata, and overall layout consistency.
- `Page`: This component acts as a wrapper for each main page's content, setting up a consistent layout across the application. It includes page-level setup such as setting the document title and logging page views via API requests to track user engagement.
- `NavBar`: This component provides the main navigation for the application, with links to key pages and various projects. It includes a dropdown menu for organizing project links and uses the `Toggle` component to highlight the currently active page.

#### Page-specific interactive components
Lower-level components are designed as containers for primary content and specific user interactions, focusing on delivering unique, immersive experiences. These components are primarily visual and are tailored to the specific needs of each page, not general reusability.
